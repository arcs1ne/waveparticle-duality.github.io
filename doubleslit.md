# Double Slit Experiment

## Young's  Experiment

The double slit experiment was conducted by Thomas Young in 1801. It involves a coherent light source (e.g. a laser beam) illuminates a plate pierced by two parallel slits, and the light passing through the slits is observed on a screen behind the plate. The wave nature of light causes the light waves passing through the two slits to interfere, producing bright and dark bands on the screen – a result that would not be expected if light consisted of classical particles. 

However, the light is always found to be absorbed at the screen at discrete points, as individual particles and not waves, and the interference pattern reflects the density of these points. Versions of the experiment that involves detectors at the slits found that each detected photon passes through one slit (like a particle), and not through both slits (like a wave). However, such experiments demonstrate that particles do not form the interference pattern if one is able to detect which slit they pass through. These results demonstrate the principle of wave–particle duality.

## Further Experiments on Electrons

Another that was interesting was that this interference pattern can also be observed with electrons. In 1974, Jönsson showed that electrons passing through slits also produced the same effect as Young’s double slit experiment. This provided evidence that electrons also had wave-like properties. But could it be possible that electrons were just interfering with other electrons? What if we made that only 1 electron would pass through the slits at any 1 time? In 1989, Tonomura and other co-workers at Hitachi decided to see what would happen. Using rather advanced technology that could detect electrons one by one, they found that the same interference pattern was also observed for a single electron, which can be thought as the electron interfering with itself.

But how can a single electron have an interference pattern? Could it be that the electron splits into both holes and somehow recombines on the other side? Maybe we can try to detect which hole (or holes) the electron went through. But here is the crazy part of quantum mechanics. When we measure something, like “did the electron pass through this hole?”, the result of the experiment will change and we will not observe the interference pattern. This had a similar effect the double slit experiment conducted on light.

## Other Variants

Since scientists have observed double slit interference in electrons, there have been quite a few attempts to perform (not necessarily double slit) interference on much bigger particles.

In 1999, a quantum interference experiment by Markus Arndt and others had successfully shown that buckyball molecules (which comprises of $60$ carbon atoms each) can interfere with each other using a diffraction grating. In 2013, a similar experiment was successfully performed with molecules with $810$ atoms each. This was raised yet again in 2019 to molecules with $2000$ atoms, which had a mass of $25000u$.
